# Asteroids_v2

A spin from the Atari Asteroids game from 1979, but with more weapons. I didn't program in death so anyone playing has to use cheat codes to add more enemies. 

This is a rewrite of my original assignment from Mr. Simon's AP Computer Science class. https://github.com/APCSLowell/AsteroidsGame

## Features 
* Decked out ship with laser, repellant, chain lightning and zero laser.
* Options panel for changing the color of your ship 
* Options panel for changing controls (doesn't work on Mac)
* Anti-aliasing for smoother rendering

## Controls
Move - Left Mouse button OR WASD OR Arrow Keys

Space - Fire primary weapon

Tab - Show weapon cooldowns 

Left CTRL - Hyperspace 

1-9 - Weapons

0 - Toggle Debug mode (adds a shield, unlimited bullets and gives a lot more HP) 

F1 - Options Panel for changing ship color and game controls

F5 - Partially lower health 

F6 - Multiply speed by 1.1

F8 - Kill all asteroids 

F9 - Add new asteroids

F11 - Add new small asteroids

F12 - Restart game

## Install
All code is in the src folder.
Asteroids can either be a Java Applet or Java Application. `main()` is in `mainClass.java`.

## Motivation 
This was my form of artwork in high school: developing a bunch of weapons to kill imaginary asteroids using nothing but lines and circles as building blocks. It was like being a space engineer without any money, any physics or electrical or mechanical knowledge. 

### Why didn't you make it into a commercial game? 
I thought hard about making this into a real game that I could sell on Steam, but I felt like that was 10x the work. I would have had to do the level design, stats balancing, boss design, sound design, customer feedback, optimization to 60+ FPS, visual polish beyond lines and circles. A new "Geometry wars" had just been released too, so my motivation died because I didn't want to release an inferior copy. Yes I can carve out another niche within the arcade genre. I just have to be more creative.

### How much time did you spend on this? 
A few hundred hours. 

### Which weapon was the hardest to make
The reinforcements and chain lighting were very difficult. I had to think of all the psudocode in my head before writing anything. You can read it in `Reinforcements outline.txt`

## I want some ideas to make my Asteroids unique
Weapon ideas: black hole, lasso, powerups, snakes, fire, gravity wave

Mechanics ideas: play the map on a 3D sphere instead of a 2D rectangle, control more than one ship at a time, make a space tower defense

Alternatively, remove the space theme and make another kind of shooter
