				Else, ("less than 20 floaters boolean" is true) (inconsistent)
					If "retract" timer is not running
						Retract into the ring, when done
							Set "less than 20 floaters boolean" to false
						If individual "bounty" timers are on
							turn them all off

			Else (less than 20 floaters)
				If "less than 20 floaters boolean" is false (inconsistent)
					If this is the last ship in the group
						Set "less than 20 floaters boolean" to true
					If there are any bad guys 
						Start all ship timers
						Assign each ship a target
					If "retract" timer is on,
